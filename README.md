# Supplementary data for PhD thesis 

"Frameworks for reprogramming lower plant systems" by Bernardo Pollak.

This repository includes supplementary data and files for my PhD thesis. Folders are included with material referenced in the chapters.

## Image analysis scripts

Scripts are documented with comments describing the use of commands. Commented sections were used for specific purposes, such as saving of images or data processing.

## Sequences

Sequences are distributed in two folders according to the method used for assembly.
